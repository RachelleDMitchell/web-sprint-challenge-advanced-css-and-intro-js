How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?
    Accesibility is making your website accessible to everyone. 


Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible.
    If someone is using a screen reader you would want to make sure you alt text for images and semantic html 
    and css for everything so that the screen reader can comprehend your site.
    You can also make your site responsive to different sized sreens that way no matter what device a person is
    using they can still get the most out of your site.
    Another way would be to make sure sizing is not hard coded so that if a person zooms or adjusts the font size
    the website will grow with it and not stay one size.



How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?
    A variable is used to store data values.


What is the purpose of using functions in code?
    Functions are good for executing tasks.
